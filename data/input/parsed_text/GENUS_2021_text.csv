STRATEGIC PROGRESS

DELIVERING A 
DIFFERENTIATED 
PROPRIETARY GENETIC 
OFFERING

 > Delivered further increases in 

genetic merit across all targeted 
traits 

 > Continued to expand our network 

of elite nucleus farms; started 
construction on a joint venture 
genetic nucleus in Brazil and a new 
owned elite nucleus in Canada 

 > Increased global dissemination of 
elite genetics despite constraints 
created by COVID-19, flying 
18,500 animals to 26 countries, 
including 13,000 pureline gilts to 
multiplication facilities in Russia 
and China

FOCUSING ON LARGE AND 
PROGRESSIVE PROTEIN 
PRODUCERS GLOBALLY

 > Grew adjusted operating profits in 
Asia by 49%, driven particularly by 
increasing demand in China and 
underpinned by further expansion 
of our local supply chain 

 > Delivered adjusted operating profit 
growth of 13% across Europe, aided 
by our focus on large producers and 
expansion of our distribution network 
to support smaller customers 

 > Maintained previous performance 

levels in North America, despite  
the local impact of COVID-19, 
helped by sales of our PIC800  
boar through new accounts  
with large producers 

 > Increased adjusted operating 

profit in Latin America by 17%, with 
particularly strong performance 
from Brazil 

SHARING IN THE 
VALUE DELIVERED

 > Agreed further royalty contracts 
around the world, so that 78% of 
our business is now conducted 
on this basis (including 36% of our 
business in China)

 > Strengthened our relationship with 

a major integrated producer in Latin 
America, through a contract that 
will see royalty payments increase 
each year, consistent with the 
incremental and cumulative value 
PIC genetics bring to its business 
 > Conducted a further 28 product 

trials, involving 87,056 pigs, to show 
producers the benefits of using PIC 
genetics in their systems

nucleus farm to house 3,600 elite animals

STRATEGIC PROGRESS 
IN 2020/21

DELIVERING A 
DIFFERENTIATED 
PROPRIETARY GENETIC 
OFFERING

 > Continued to generate industry-

leading dairy bulls and established 
our Elite Sire programme, offering 
customers early access to genomic 
sires of high genetic merit 

 > Increased the number of NuEra 

beef bulls in our nucleus facilities 
and brought more of these 
high genetic merit animals into 
production for customers 

 > Grew global sales volumes of 

sexed genetics (including Sexcel, 
our proprietary product) by 29%, 
NuEra Genetics by 53% and Beef 
InFocus (our global beef-on-dairy 
brand) by 15% 

FOCUSING ON LARGE AND 
PROGRESSIVE PROTEIN 
PRODUCERS GLOBALLY

 > Continued to increase sales 
of Sexcel in new and existing 
markets, with particularly strong 
performance in China (up 151%)  
and Russia (up 154%)

 > Increased use of digital sales 

platforms in Latin America, 
contributing to volume growth of 
20% (17% of which came from new 
customers), especially in Brazil  
(up 33%) 

 > Strengthened our service to 

the largest herds in the US, by 
establishing a strategic account 
management team to support 
current and potential customers 

 > Enhanced our BeefAdvantage 
index in the UK, by adding feed 
efficiency as a selection trait, using 
market-focused performance data 

SHARING IN THE 
VALUE DELIVERED

 > Enrolled over 125 large customers in 

our Key Account Partner Program, 
through which we become their 
exclusive genetic partner and 
provide a holistic service for a 
monthly fee 

 > Conducted two beef validation 
trials with feeders and packers 
around the world, to demonstrate 
the superior performance of NuEra 
Genetics and increase demand 
through the supply chain 

In the bovine genetics marketplace, 
the significant investment required to 
run competitive breeding programmes
