 - Salaries take account of complexity 
of the role, market competitiveness, 
Group performance and the 
increases awarded to the wider 
workforce

 - More significant increases may be 
awarded at the discretion of the 
Committee, for example where there 
is a change in responsibilities, to

 - Maximum bonus only payable for 

achieving demanding targets

alignment with shareholders’ interests 
and assists with retention

objectives will determine the majority 
of the award and will typically include 
a measure of profitability and cash 
flow, although the Committee has 
discretion to select other metrics
 - Non-financial objectives will be 

measurable and linked to goals that 
are consistent with the Group’s

 - Payment of the non-financial

an underpin based on the 
Committee’s assessment of 
underlying business performance, 
including inter alia levels of 
profitability and cash flow, as well as 
health and safety performance
